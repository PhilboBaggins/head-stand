# Head stand

3D printable stands for some foam mannequin heads I bought. The heads bottom of the heads weren't flat so I designed these stands to hold them up.

There were two different heads; one male and one female. They were slightly different in size so I made two different stands.

Design was done in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and saved as `Head stand.blend`. STL files (`Head stand-Famale_stand.stl` and `Head stand-Male_stand.stl`
) were exported from Blender, and are ready to be printed.

## Example

Here is a photo of female head stand printed in resin, spray painted grey and then attached to the bottom of the mannequin head:
